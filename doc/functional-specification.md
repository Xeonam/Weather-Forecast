## Use cases

The software operates without the functionality of user profiles,
which means it lacks user authentication and user roles. When
a user initiates the program, they are automatically identified
as a "user" In this capacity, they enjoy unrestricted access to
all the features that the software offers. 

However, it's essential to note that this software doesn't
incorporate any administrative privileges. Users are unable to
modify or customize the software's properties, and they have no 
control over any settings. The absence of user profiles and
administrative roles simplifies the user's interaction with the
program, offering a seamless and straightforward gaming experience.

This kind of approach can be beneficial for a weather forecasting
application for the following reasons:

- Simplicity and User-Friendliness:
The absence of authentication and user profiles means that users
can start using the app immediately without the need for
registration or login. This is an extremely user-friendly approach
that minimizes initial barriers and provides quick access to
weather information.
