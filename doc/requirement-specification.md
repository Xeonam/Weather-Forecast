## Applied business processes

Before introducing our weather forecast program, let's delve into the 
current traditional methods of disseminating weather information via 
television and radio. We aim to replace or enhance these processes. 
Below, we outline the existing business processes for obtaining weather 
forecasts from television and radio:


1. Television Weather Forecast
* Current State:

  *  People rely on television news broadcasts to obtain current weather
forecasts.
  * Television weather forecasts are typically delivered twice daily, 
  with a limited duration within news broadcasts.

2. 2. Radio Weather Forecast
* Current State:

  * Weather forecasts are also disseminated via radio broadcasts, 
  though these are typically presented in audio format.
  * Radio weather reports often lack depth and detail.

3. Synchronization and Wait Time
* Current State:

  * To access television and radio weather forecasts, individuals must 
  be tuned in to the broadcasts at specific times.
  * Weather information can become outdated, particularly in the case 
  of longer television news segments.

4. Limited Interactivity
* Current State:

  * Television and radio weather forecasts are a passive mode of 
  information consumption, with no room for interaction or 
  personalization.

5. Insufficient Information
* Current State:

  * Television and radio weather reports often lack comprehensive or 
  location-specific details that would be relevant to everyone.

The weather forecast web application aims to modernize and expand these 
traditional processes, particularly those reliant on television and 
radio broadcasts. The application allows individuals to access detailed 
and up-to-date weather information at their convenience, customize 
forecasts to their preferences, and gain in-depth insights into weather 
phenomena. With this advanced system, our goal is to provide weather 
forecasts in a modern, interactive, and customizable manner, 
eliminating the need for passive consumption and synchronized viewing.
